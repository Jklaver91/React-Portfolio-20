## Description

The Challenge twenty assignment tasked us with creating a portfolio website using REACT.

This was accomplished by using the modules from the previous week to understand important ideas cuch as a tabbed nav bar, using JSX for things like links, and a form submission. Bootstrap was also extremely useful to style the portfolio.
